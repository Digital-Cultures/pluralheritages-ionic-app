  "MORE-INFO" : "‘Plural Heritages of Istanbul: the Case of the Land Walls’ was a research project led by Newcastle University, UK, with Istanbul Bilgi University and Bursa Uludağ University. It asked how communities give meaning to major heritage sites and what happens when such meanings are intertwined with histories of conflict and marginalisation, or are not officially recognised. Our project explored the ‘plural heritages’ of the Istanbul Land (‘Theodosian’) Walls and their environs.
