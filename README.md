## Description

## Notes:
The [deviceorientationabsolute](http://w3c.github.io/deviceorientation/spec-source-orientation.html#deviceorientationabsolute
See: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/device-orientation-changes) dosn't seem to work on my android phone and deviceorientation didnt give a true north, so used the [cordova-plugin-device-orientation] (https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-device-orientation) and this seemed to work.
